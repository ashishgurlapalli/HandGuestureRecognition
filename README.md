📖 Usage Guide
1. Data Collection
Navigate to "Collect Data" tab
Enter a gesture name (e.g., "thumbs_up")
Click "Start Data Collection"
Show your hand to the camera
Press 's' to save samples (20-30 recommended)
Press 'q' when finished

2. Model Training
Collect at least 2 different gestures
Go to "Train Model" tab
Click "Start Training"
Wait for training to complete (1-5 minutes)
Review accuracy metrics

3. Real-time Recognition
Ensure model is trained
Navigate to "Real-time Recognition" tab
Click "Start Recognition"
Perform gestures in front of camera
View real-time predictions
Press 'q' to exit recognition window
